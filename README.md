In this notebook we will explore XGboost to build collection of boosted tree, and use continuous and categorical data from the IBM Base samples to predict whether or not customer will stop using a company's service. In business lingo, this is called customer churn, you can download the [telco churn dataset](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cognos-analytics/11.1.0?topic=samples-telco-customer-churn).
